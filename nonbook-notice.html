    <h1>Note from the ZWIBook editors:</h1>

        This is an unusual file. It was posted to Project Gutenberg only in RTF (Rich Text Format), which ZWIBook does not support.
        However, for the convenience of ZWIBook readers, we used a simple (LibreOffice Writer) HTML exporter for the RTF file,
        combining it with the placeholder HTML found on the Project Gutenberg website. We present the result to you here. If you 
        wish to see the original Project Gutenberg RTF file, please download the ZWI file for this book. To do that, look in the 
        menu above under <code>File &gt; Export ZWI (original book files)</code>. We apologize for any inconvenience.
