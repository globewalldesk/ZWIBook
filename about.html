        <p class="about-intro"><span class="dropcap">Z</span>WIBook is a user-friendly digital library application. The software can be used to find and read books, highlight them, take notes, do research, and more. The ZWI format is a self-contained ZIP file originally designed for encyclopedia articles. ZWIBook allows users to access the vast collection of texts from Project Gutenberg as of December 2023. With over 69,000 texts—primarily books published before 1920—ZWIBook was written to show off the usefulness of the ZWI file format. All of the book ZWI files can be easily found in the <code>/book_zwis</code> directory on the thumb drive.</p>
        
        <p class="about-intro">We, the Knowledge Standards Foundation (KSF), are a 501(c)(3) nonprofit technical organization that is attempting to create the <a href="https://encyclosphere.org">Encyclosphere</a>, which organizes, disseminates, and promotes free and decentralized knowledge. We wanted to give donors a compelling reason to support our efforts, by involving them in the preservation of knowledge.</p>

        <p class="about-intro" id="abtoc">If enough people have these drives, we will have made the digital censorship of these books, at least, essentially impossible. The preservation of knowledge is what the KSF stands for. If there is a solid demand, we might make a version containing nothing but encyclopedias (a greatly expanded offline version of our Oldpedia.org). Please note that the KSF has no special relationship with Project Gutenberg, and we use their files according to their generous license (on which, see below).</p>

                <li>This process establishes that, according to the DID:PSQR and JSON Web Token protocols, only the private key that matches dara.global's public key (at the above address) could have generated that particular token.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><b>A permanent library in your pocket?!</b> 70,000 local copies of books, in the palm of your hand. It's pretty darned cool knowing that, as long as you have this thumb drive, you will be able to access <i>all those books.</i> The fact that you can search and read the books, and highlight and take notes on them, on any computer with the drive just makes it better.</li>
                <li><b>Anti-censorship.</b> We are preserving (future-proofing, you might say) knowledge in the face of the very real threat of censorship. Having many copies of these thumb drives, with about 70,000 signed book files, helps us as a society to guarantee that there are many copies of the original Project Gutenberg files, as well as of the books themselves.</li>
                <li><b>AI concerns.</b> Our world is increasingly having to deal with AI-generated text, which makes it possible for unscrupulous people to counterfeit data. Your copy of the Project Gutenberg library is a massive trove of human-written content; the fact that the books are stored offline means your copies are stable and unchanging; and the digitally-signed ZWI format proves they are reliable.</li>
                <li><b>Hey, this software is actually <i>good!</i></b> We put in the time needed to make this software usable. Title search is fast and works well. The category feature is useful. The bookshelf lets you highlight particular books in the library and track your reading history. And as far as the reader itself goes, works well: font choice and size, page zoom, bookmarks, find-on-page, and research tools. And, in our tests, the files looked consistently good—sometimes better than the Project Gutenberg originals.</li>
                <li><b>You're supporting the KSF.</b> Apart from the merits of the software itself, this software supports the Knowledge Standards Foundation, a small technical organization devoted to spreading free and uncensored knowledge, beginning with encyclopedias, but including other sorts of knowledge as well. <span id="troubleshooting"></span>Your donation helps keep our mission alive. Thanks!</li>

            <h2><a href="#abtoc">↑</a> q&a and troubleshooting</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Can I move the books to my computer?</b> Of course. While you might be tempted to drag-and-drop, and while that <i>might</i> work, be aware that it is an enormous collection. Make sure you have at least 125 GIGABYTES of free space before you start. It might be better to use the command line to make the transfer, if you (or a friend) know how, or else some special file transfer software. Once you have made the transfer (the directory you put the books in must be named "book_zwis"), you'll want to tell ZWIBook where the files are. Take note of where the directory you just made is, and then select <code>Help > Reset Books Location</code> in the menu at the top of the app; find the directory, click on it, and press "Open". If all has gone well, you should see the same books. Doing this <i>does not</i> move your highlights or other personal data.</li>
                <li><b>How do I back up my bookshelf, bookmarks, highlights, and notes?</b> It's probably a good idea to back up this data, especially if you work on it much. <a href="#hn">Look above</a> under "Highlights and notes"; see "To export or import highlight/note data."</li>

                <li><b>The books should be well-rendered, but this is not guaranteed.</b> We took great care to craft the ZWIBook software, which you are using now, to render the books in a fairly standardized, readable format, while retaining most of the original design of the book files. Standardizing did involve actually overriding some of the CSS of the original files. It should not have touched the content, but we have not confirmed that this is the case with every file. Some design errors might still remain, but they should be relatively few. If you come across a book with moderate or serious design errors, especially if it is entirely unreadable, please email larry@encyclosphere.org with details.</li>

                <li><b>All the ZWI files are there.</b> We guarantee that the book ZWI files were included in the <code>/book_zwis</code> directory shipped out on the original Knowledge Standards Foundation thumb drives.</li>

                <li><b>Software presented "as-is."</b> We do not make any specific guarantees about the ZWIBook software, which you are presently using. It is offered as a "thank-you" gift for contributions to the Knowledge Standards Foundation. ZWIBook is presented "as-is" and is not guaranteed to be free of defects or to be fit for any particular purpose. Although it was thoroughly tested on Linux, Windows, and Mac, we cannot guarantee it to work properly on every system. We also cannot guarantee that it will continue to work forever, as operating systems are updated.</li>

                <li><b>KSF has no relationship with Project Gutenberg.</b>The <a href="https://encyclosphere.org" target="_blank">Knowledge Standards Foundation</a> does not have any relationship with <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/" target="_blank">Project Gutenberg</a>.</li>
                    
                <li><b>We have respected the Project Gutenberg license.</b> We have distributed versions of the Project Gutenberg files in the ZWI format in the belief that our doing so satisfies the Project Gutenberg license, which we have carefully read, and which is to be found at the bottom of every Project Gutenberg file (and as can be found in our copies of these files).</li>

                <li><b>The gist of the PG license.</b> To adapt the Project Gutenberg summary license: "The eBooks in this collection are for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy them, give them away or re-use them under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with each eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where you are located before using these eBooks."</li>

                <li><b>Authors.</b> Distributed on a 128GB thumb drive, ZWIBook is a bespoke software solution created by Larry Sanger with the help of AI tools, with assistance from Henry Sanger. We thank "BGNLouie" for converting the entire (as of December 2023) Project Gutenberg database into the ZWI format. The person primarily responsible for crafting the ZWI format is Dr. Sergei Chekanov, although there were additions or direction given by Henry Sanger, BGNLouie, Larry Sanger, and Shelly Warren.</li>
