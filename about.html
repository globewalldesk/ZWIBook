        <p class="about-intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>his app, which we call "ZWIBook," is a user-friendly digital library application, allowing users to access the vast collection of texts from Project Gutenberg as of December 2023. With over 69,000 texts—primarily books published before 1920—ZWIBook was written to show off the usefulness of the ZWI file format. The software can be used to find and read books (and much more). The ZWI format is a self-contained ZIP file. All of the book ZWI files can be easily found in the <code>/book_zwis</code> directory.</p>
        
        <p class="about-intro" id="abtoc">We, the Knowledge Standards Foundation (KSF), wanted to give donors a compelling reason to support our efforts, by involving them in the preservation of knowledge. If enough people have these drives, we will have made the digital censorship of these books, at least, essentially impossible. The preservation of knowledge is what the KSF stands for. If there is a solid demand, we might make a version containing nothing but encyclopedias (a greatly expanded offline version of our Oldpedia.org). Please note that the KSF has no special relationship with Project Gutenberg, and we use their files according to their generous license (on which, see below).</p>

                <li>Drop the `publicKeys` into the "verify signature" area on the lower right.</li>
                <li>This process establishes that, according to the DID:PSQR and JSON Web Token protocols, only the private key that matches dara.global's public key (at the above address) could have generated that particular token.</li>
                <li>Some further steps can, in a similarly rigorous way, establish that only the same private key could take all the content of the ZWI file as input and generate that token as output.</li>
                <li>Among other info you can confirm in this way, you can discover that Louis generated these ZWI files in December 2023—for which we at the Knowledge Standards Foundation are very grateful!</li>

        <h2><a href="#abtoc">↑</a> Notes and Disclaimers</h2>
        <p><b>Should be well-rendered; not guaranteed.</b> We took great care to craft the ZWIBook software, which you using now, to render the books in a fairly standardized, readable format, while retaining most of the original design of the book files. Standardizing did involve actually overriding some of the CSS of the original files. It should not have touched the content, but we have not confirmed that this is the case with every file. Some design errors might still remain, but they should be relatively few. If you come across a book with moderate or serious design errors, especially if it is entirely unreadable, please email larry@encyclosphere.org with details.</p>

        <p><b>All the ZWI files are there.</b> We guarantee that the book ZWI files were included in the <code>/book_zwis</code> directory shipped out on the original Knowledge Standards Foundation thumb drives.</p>

        <p><b>Software presented "as-is."</b> We do not make any specific guarantees about the ZWIBook software, which you are presently using. It is offered as a "thank-you" gift for contributions to the Knowledge Standards Foundation. ZWIBook is presented "as-is" and is not guaranteed to be free of defects or to be fit for any particular purpose. Although it was thoroughly tested on Linux, Windows, and Mac, we cannot guarantee it to work properly on every system. We also cannot guarantee that it will continue to work forever, as operating systems are updated.</p>

        <p><b>We have respected the Project Gutenberg license.</b> We have distributed versions of the Project Gutenberg files in the ZWI format in the belief that our doing so satisfies the Project Gutenberg license, which we have carefully read, and which is to be found at the bottom of every Project Gutenberg file (and as can be found in our copies of these files).</p>
