        <h1>Getting Started with ZWIBook</h1>
        <p>Your flash drive should contain 128GB of data, almost completely full of books with the '.zwi' extension, located in the 'book_zwis' folder. They are required to run the software. To search, read, save, bookmark, highlight, and take notes on the books, start ZWIBook.</p>
        
        <h2>How to Run ZWIBook</h2>
        <p>Observe there are 'Linux', 'Mac', and 'Windows' folders on the drive. Open the folder that matches your operating system, then:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>For Windows: Double-click 'ZWIBook.exe' to start the app.</li>
            <li>For Mac: Double-click 'ZWIBook.dmg', then drag the ZWIBook icon from left to right into the Applications folder. After that, you can start the app from your Applications folder. <b>Mac users note:</b> If this doesn't work, and you are using Apple Silicon (post-2020 Mac), then you can try double-clicking 'ZWIBook.app' in the 'mac-arm64' folder. That should work. Older Mac users can try double-clicking 'ZWIBook.app' in the 'mac' folder.</code></li>
            <li>For Linux: You have two choices, 'ZWIBook.AppImage' and 'ZWIBook.deb'. It's easier to double-click 'ZWIBook.AppImage' to start the app, but the deb file should work too.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>First-Time Setup</h2>
        <p>When you first run the app, you may be prompted to specify the location of the book files. If you are running the app from the flash drive, select the 'Thumb drive' option. If you have moved the book files to your desktop or another location, navigate to that directory. If you choose the wrong option, you can always use 'File > Reset Books Location' and select the correct 'zwi_books' folder.</p>

        <h2>Sample Bookshelf, Highlight, and Note Data</h2>
        <p>If you want to see Larry Sanger's PG book collection (as of July 2024), go to 'File > Import/Export User Data > Import Bookshelf Data', and select 'bookshelf.json' inside the '/sample_bookshelf_notes' folder. You can also try 'Import Highlight/Note Data'; to do this, you'd import 'hlnote.json' in the same folder. I don't have many highlights or notes, but I spent a few hours on Luther's <i>Concerning Christian Liberty.</i> In that book, be sure to try to highlight button in the page header, to see how highlights and notes are neatly summarized.</p>
        
        <h2>Data Backup</h2>
        <p>If you take notes, make bookmarks, and collect a bookshelf, it is strongly recommended to back up your data regularly. While the app is designed to be robust, we cannot guarantee that unforeseen glitches won't cause data loss. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED; WE WILL NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR DATA LOSS.</p>

        <h2>Note about the book files</h2>
        <p>The book files are ZIP files, formatted following the ZWI file format; you can open them with any ZIP reader, but it's much easier to use the ZWIBook reader software.</p>

        <h2>Getting Help</h2>
        <p>For more help, open the app and navigate to 'Help > About ZWIBook'. This section provides detailed information and assistance for using the application. As a last result you can try emailing larry@encyclosphere.org (the developer). Please do not bother Project Gutenberg, as they are not responsible for this software.</p>
